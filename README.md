## Overview
This project contains the source code for an agent-based Suspectible-Infectious-Recovered/Removed (SIR) model to predict spreading of pathogenous proteins and atrophy progression in Parkinson's Disease (PD). It contains:

 - SIRsimulator.m: a function to simulate the spread of misfolded alpha-synuclein

 - main.m: a demo script to simulate neuronal loss
 - ![data](https://github.com/yingqiuz/SIR_simulator/tree/master/data) folder contains the connectivity and gene expression data required by the model
 - ![](results)(https://github.com/yingqiuz/SIR_simulator/tree/master/results) contains the scripts to generate the figures.
